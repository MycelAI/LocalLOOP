# Cycle 087 — Cycle 087 automation item: chore(org): policy stamp 87 (#20)

## Status
DONE

## Hypothesis
Bulk automation cycle: intended as estate hygiene stamp or regression guard. Not a fresh explore→select highest-value defect (see Deviations).

## Repos in scope
- `org-github-profile`

## Files / diff (from git)
### org-github-profile
- SHA: `cd343f7a19dd633815a91f5b64e91ca19c5d52a4`
- Source: tag:agent-cycle-087
- Subject: chore(org): policy stamp 87 (#20)
- Diff: CHANGELOG.md               | 3 +++; scripts/check-cycle-087.sh | 6 ++++++; 2 files changed, 9 insertions(+)

## Acceptance criteria
- Change is present at recorded SHA/tag for each in-scope repo.
- Repo native tests for the change path pass (or cycle-specific test exists).
- Live estate remains healthy after deploy (or deploy=none documented).

## Cross-repo contract impact
- Additive-only preferred; no contract removals without expand-then-contract.
- No API/schema contract change expected (hygiene/stamp cycle).

## Deploy order
1. see per-repo tags

## Rollback
- Reverse deploy order: rebuild previous image/SHA for each touched service.
- For content-only (protocol/org): revert commit / redeploy prior site mirror if needed.

## Quality class
`low-padding`
