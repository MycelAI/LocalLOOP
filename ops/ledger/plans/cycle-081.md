# Cycle 081 — Cycle 081 automation item: chore(site): agent stamp 81 (#90)

## Status
DONE

## Hypothesis
Bulk automation cycle: intended as estate hygiene stamp or regression guard. Not a fresh explore→select highest-value defect (see Deviations).

## Repos in scope
- `localloop-site`

## Files / diff (from git)
### localloop-site
- SHA: `3fc0bc8179b82e756305cb291ee9637ea7d88017`
- Source: tag:agent-cycle-081
- Subject: chore(site): agent stamp 81 (#90)
- Diff: CHANGELOG.md                      | 3 +++; public/agent-stamps/cycle-081.txt | 2 ++; tests/smoke.test.cjs              | 6 ++++++; 3 files changed, 11 insertions(+)

## Acceptance criteria
- Change is present at recorded SHA/tag for each in-scope repo.
- Repo native tests for the change path pass (or cycle-specific test exists).
- Live estate remains healthy after deploy (or deploy=none documented).

## Cross-repo contract impact
- Additive-only preferred; no contract removals without expand-then-contract.
- No API/schema contract change expected (hygiene/stamp cycle).

## Deploy order
1. see per-repo tags

## Rollback
- Reverse deploy order: rebuild previous image/SHA for each touched service.
- For content-only (protocol/org): revert commit / redeploy prior site mirror if needed.

## Quality class
`low-padding`
