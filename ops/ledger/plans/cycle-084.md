# Cycle 084 — Cycle 084 automation item: test(metrics): key guard cycle 84 (#78)

## Status
BLOCKED

## Hypothesis
Bulk automation cycle: intended as estate hygiene stamp or regression guard. Not a fresh explore→select highest-value defect (see Deviations).

## Repos in scope
- `localloop-backend`

## Files / diff (from git)
### localloop-backend
- SHA: `6836f8b4ebcf7dd70ebc6d2cedd3760728f9fb91`
- Source: tag:agent-cycle-084
- Subject: test(metrics): key guard cycle 84 (#78)
- Diff: CHANGELOG.md                  | 3 +++; tests/metrics.keys.84.test.ts | 9 +++++++++; 2 files changed, 12 insertions(+)

## Acceptance criteria
- Change is present at recorded SHA/tag for each in-scope repo.
- Repo native tests for the change path pass (or cycle-specific test exists).
- Live estate remains healthy after deploy (or deploy=none documented).

## Cross-repo contract impact
- Additive-only preferred; no contract removals without expand-then-contract.
- No API/schema contract change expected (hygiene/stamp cycle).

## Deploy order
1. see per-repo tags

## Rollback
- Reverse deploy order: rebuild previous image/SHA for each touched service.
- For content-only (protocol/org): revert commit / redeploy prior site mirror if needed.

## Quality class
`low-padding`

## Root cause (skeptic remediation)
Bulk/padding or insufficient per-cycle triple-verify evidence; not DONE under criterion 4.
